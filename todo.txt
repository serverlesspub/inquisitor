- [x] publish the web site along with cloudformation, so people don't have to run jekyll locally
- [x] allow people to set region and profile directly when calling make, not in .env
- [x] allow setting provisioned concurrency and memory as parameters when calling make
- [ ] move instance reporting to a header, so the content can be anything
- [ ] add tests to read files from the local lambda fs and stream back; compare to s3 load in the same region
